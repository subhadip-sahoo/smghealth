In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation.</p>\r\n<p class="text-justify"><strong>1.1.2Individual Employee Resilience</strong> </p>\r\n<p class="text-justify">Like organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work. Consequently an holistic approach to building resilience capacity needs to take into account both individual and organisational requirements.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 ">\r\n<p><strong>1.2 HOW RESILIENCE HELPS AN ORGANISATION?</strong></p>\r\n<p class="text-justify">Being resilient can provide organisations with a competitive advantage. Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><strong>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</strong>\r\n<ul class="list-inline right_nav text-justify">\r\n	<li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n	<li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n	<li>Workshops&amp; WebEx vignettes\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n	<li>Stress &amp; Resilience</li>\r\n	<li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.4 Stress Management </strong></p>\r\n<p class="text-justify">The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee. Consequently this can then impact negatively on workplace productivity. This is seen in increasing absenteeism, presenteeism, workers compensations costs, workplace conflict all of which work against the outcomes the organisation is seeking. Our stress management interventions will ensure greater safety, well-being and performance of your workforce while improving the productivity of the whole organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.5 Mindfulness and workplace engagement </strong></p><p class="text-justify">Engagement in our work matters. Low levels of engagement impact productivity and our sense of self-esteem. Most modern workplaces are undergoing constant change. Some far reaching and some subtle but all impacting to lesser or greater extent on employees. When substantive changes to our work (design, reporting duties etc.) occurs, we often need targeted mechanisms that provide employees with alternate pathways aimed at empowering them to take positive steps to reappraise their own circumstances. We have designed a number of workplace mindfulness programmes that focus on teaching employees the importance of taking responsibility for what is occurring in the present, and responding in ways that enhanced personal wellbeing and greater workplace engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n', 'Mental Health, Sleep & Fatigue Management', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mental-health-sleep-fatigue-management', '', '', '2015-07-07 04:11:13', '2015-07-07 04:11:13', '', 71, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/?page_id=77', 0, 'page', '', 0),

HOW AND WHEN DOES SMG HEALTH COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>\r\n<ul class="list_none_nav">\r\n  <li> <strong>8.1</strong> SMG Health usually collects personal information in a variety of ways, and often from a third party, in the course of conducting its businesses, including:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>    (a)  from its clients when it provides products or services to those clients (for example, SMG Health may collect a clientâ€™s email address, name, date of birth and other contact information);\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (b)  when responding to questions regarding SMG Healthâ€™s products or services;\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (c)  when interacting with people via SMG Healthâ€™s website; and\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (d)  when conducting marketing and business development events.</li>\r\n  \r\n  </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <li><strong>8.2 </strong> Where reasonable and practicable, SMG Health will collect personal information directly from the person and inform the person that this is being done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>9.

The following are some reasons why SMG Health collects personal information for some of its products and services:\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>    (a)  Corporate wellness programs â€“ to assist customersâ€™ employees to implement healthy habits for sustainable behavioural change;\r\n</li>\r\n     <li>    (b)  Health assessments â€“ to provide health screening assessments for individuals;\r\n</li>\r\n      <li>    (c)  Online wellness â€“ to assist an individual in assessing their health risks and goals;\r\n</li>\r\n       <li>    (d)  Smoking cessation â€“ for individuals to take responsibility for and overcome their addition to tobacco;\r\n</li>\r\n        <li>    (e)  Flu Vaccination â€“ to reduce the risk in an individual contracting influenza;\r\n</li>\r\n         <li>    (f)  Weight management â€“ to provide weight management solutions;\r\n</li>\r\n            <li>    (g)  Trouble-shooting reported problems, education and other support for SMG Healthâ€™s diagnostic and laboratory tests;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>    (h)  Other health products and services â€“ products and services designed to assist the individual with wellbeing solutions.</li>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  <li><strong>9.4</strong> SMG Health holds personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.5 </strong> SMG Health respects the individualâ€™s privacy concerns when personal information is disclosed and will take reasonable steps to keep it strictly confidential.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.6</strong> SMG Health will disclose personal information to third parties if it is necessary to perform a service for which the primary purpose of the information was collected, or for a related secondary purpose, if the disclosure could be reasonably expected.  For example, SMG Health may share personal information with suppliers and other parties to allow delivery of the product or service. Where such a disclosure is necessary, SMG Health will take reasonable steps to ensure the third party treats the personal information in accordance with the Applicable Regulations.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.7</strong> SMG Health may use personal information to send newsletters, to inform individuals about special offers or events, or for marketing purposes. Individuals can choose not to receive such communications. </li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.8 </strong> SMG Health may also buy, sell, merge or restructure its business or assets and personal information may be transferred as part of that change.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.9.</strong> Otherwise, SMG Health will only disclose personal information to third parties without the relevant individualâ€™s consent if the disclosure is permitted by Applicable Regulations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>10.

Importantly these services assist in fulfilling our mission to provide holistic health services to organisations to enhance well-being and productivity. Initially our services will focus on 3 key areas: resilience; stress management; & mindfulness. All these services will be key components of our Resilience, Wellbeing and Productivity programme. Later in 2015 we will be implementing a full online capability linking all these services across face to face, telephonic and on line delivery platforms leading to coaching, workshop, counselling, facilitation, assessment, and consulting services.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n      <h2>Building Resilience Overview:</h2>\r\n      <strong>1.1    WHAT IS RESILIENCE?</strong>\r\n      <ul class="list-inline">\r\n        <li><strong>1.1.1</strong> Organisational Resilience\r\n          The capacity of resilience is found in an organisationâ€™s culture, attitudes and values. In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\n          Resilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation. </li>\r\n        <li><strong>1.1.2</strong> Individual Employee Resilience\r\n          Like organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work. Consequently an holistic approach to building resilience capacity needs to take into account both individual and organisational requirements. </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n      <h2>1.2 HOW RESILIENCE HELPS AN ORGANISATION?</h2>\r\n      <p>Being resilient can provide organisations with a competitive advantage. Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n      <h2>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</h2>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n            <li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n        <li>Workshops& WebEx vignettes\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n            <li>Stress & Resilience</li>\r\n            <li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n            <li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n      <h2>1.4 Stress Management</h2>\r\n      <p>The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee. Consequently this can then impact negatively on workplace productivity. This is seen in increasing absenteeism, presenteeism, workers compensations costs, workplace conflict all of which work against the outcomes the organisation is seeking. Our stress management interventions will ensure greater safety, well-being and performance of your workforce while improving the productivity of the whole organisation.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n      <h2>1.5 Mindfulness and workplace engagement</h2>\r\n      <p>Engagement in our work matters. Low levels of engagement impact productivity and our sense of self-esteem. Most modern workplaces are undergoing constant change.

In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>1.1.2</strong> Individual Employee Resilience\r\nLike organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work.

Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2"><strong>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n	<li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n	<li>Workshops&amp; WebEx vignettes\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n	<li>Stress &amp; Resilience</li>\r\n	<li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2"><strong>1.4 Stress Management </strong>The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee.

A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors.

In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>1.1.2</strong> Individual Employee Resilience</li>\r\nLike organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work. Consequently an holistic approach to building resilience capacity needs to take into account both individual and organisational requirements.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2">\r\n<p><strong>1.2 HOW RESILIENCE HELPS AN ORGANISATION?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being resilient can provide organisations with a competitive advantage. Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2"><strong>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n	<li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n	<li>Workshops&amp; WebEx vignettes\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n	<li>Stress &amp; Resilience</li>\r\n	<li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2"><p><strong>1.4 Stress Management </strong></p>\r\n<p>The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee. Consequently this can then impact negatively on workplace productivity. This is seen in increasing absenteeism, presenteeism, workers compensations costs, workplace conflict all of which work against the outcomes the organisation is seeking. Our stress management interventions will ensure greater safety, well-being and performance of your workforce while improving the productivity of the whole organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 m_t2"><p><strong>1.5 Mindfulness and workplace engagement </strong></p><p>Engagement in our work matters. Low levels of engagement impact productivity and our sense of self-esteem. Most modern workplaces are undergoing constant change. Some far reaching and some subtle but all impacting to lesser or greater extent on employees. When substantive changes to our work (design, reporting duties etc.) occurs, we often need targeted mechanisms that provide employees with alternate pathways aimed at empowering them to take positive steps to reappraise their own circumstances. We have designed a number of workplace mindfulness programmes that focus on teaching employees the importance of taking responsibility for what is occurring in the present, and responding in ways that enhanced personal wellbeing and greater workplace engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Mental Health, Sleep & Fatigue Management', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '77-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-06 05:20:51', '2015-07-06 05:20:51', '', 77, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/77-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This commitment is demonstrated in this Privacy Policy.\r\n1.3Â  Personal information held by SMG Health will be treated in accordance with the Applicable Regulations.\r\n1.4Â  This Policy also sets out the broad controls which SMG Health has adopted to govern the way it uses personal information, the circumstances in which it might disclose personal information to third parties, how persons can access their personal information held by SMG Health and what they can do if they are unhappy with SMG Health''s treatment of their personal information.\r\n2.Â  WHO DOES THE SMG HEALTH PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?\r\n2.1Â  This Policy applies to any person for whom SMG Health currently holds, or may in the future collect, personal information.\r\n3.Â  WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE SMG HEALTH PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?\r\n3.1Â  This Policy applies to personal information. In broad terms, â€˜personal informationâ€™ is information or opinions relating to an identifiable individual.\r\n\r\n3.2Â  This Policy does not apply to acts and practices which relate directly to the employee records of SMG Healthâ€™s current and former employees. SMG Health has a separate employee Privacy Policy.\r\n4.Â  WHAT INFORMATION IS NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n4.1Â  Information is not personal information where SMG Health has removed any reference to a person, provided that the identity of the person can no longer be ascertained from the information.\r\n\r\n4.2Â  SMG Health may use this information for its own purposes and commercial gain.\r\n5.Â  HOW DOES SMG HEALTH MANAGE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?\r\n5.1Â  SMG Health manages and secures the personal information it collects by using reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards and procedures. These safeguards and procedures include but are not limited to:\r\n(a)Â  use of appropriate encryption, password, and other protections for information held electronically;\r\n(b)Â  only providing necessary personnel access to personal information;\r\n(c)Â  regularly providing staff training on privacy issues;\r\n(d)Â  implementing various procedures to assist employees in alerting customers to potential privacy issues before personal information is collected;\r\n(e)Â  regularly reviewing its privacy compliance; and\r\n(f)Â  appointing privacy officers within SMG Health organisations to monitor privacy compliance.\r\n5.2Â  The personal information collected by SMG Health is stored in a variety of ways in order to most effectively provide products and services. Storage methods include:\r\n(a)Â  paper files;\r\n(b)Â  on public or private clouds administered by third parties;\r\n(c)Â  in servers used by other SMG Health entities;\r\n5.3Â  In some cases personal information will be stored exclusively in the country of origin in order to comply with customer or other requirements.\r\n\r\n5.4Â  SMG Health will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information held by SMG Health is secure from Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  any unauthorised access or disclosure. However, SMG Health does not guarantee that personal information Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  cannot be accessed by an unauthorised person (e.g. a hacker) or that unauthorised disclosures will not Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  occur.\r\n5.5Â  SMG Health will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if that information is no longer needed.\r\n5.6Â  You may ask us to use a pseudonym or remain anonymous when providing personal information to us. However, by withholding personal information or using a pseudonym we may not be able to provide a service or part of a service to you, or you may not be able to optimally participate in our programs.\r\n6.Â  WHAT KINDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY SMG HEALTH COLLECT AND HOLD?\r\n6.1Â  SMG Health collects personal information in order to effectively provide products and services. Only information necessary to provide such products and services is collected.\r\n6.2Â  SMG Health may collect and hold personal information such as:\r\n(a)Â  contact, identification and demographic details (for example, names, street addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, date and place of birth, next of kin details, emergency contact numbers, occupation, gender, language, nationality);\r\n(b)Â  financial information (for example credit card details and account numbers); and\r\n(c)Â  sensitive information which includes health information.\r\n7. Â WHAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION MAY SMG HEALTH COLLECT AND HOLD?\r\n7.1Â  â€˜Sensitive informationâ€™ is a subset of personal information and includes personal information that may have serious ramifications for the individual concerned if used inappropriately.\r\n7.2Â  The sensitive information SMG Health may collect and hold about an individual may include:\r\n(a)Â  health and medical information;\r\n(b)Â  information regarding racial origins, ethnic origins, or other sensitive information relevant to health risk factors.\r\n8.Â  HOW AND WHEN DOES SMG HEALTH COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n8.1Â  SMG Health usually collects personal information in a variety of ways, and often from a third party, in the course of conducting its businesses, including:\r\n(a)Â  from its clients when it provides products or services to those clients (for example, SMG Health may collect a clientâ€™s email address, name, date of birth and other contact information);\r\n(b)Â  when responding to questions regarding SMG Healthâ€™s products or services;\r\n(c)Â  when interacting with people via SMG Healthâ€™s website; and\r\n(d)Â  when conducting marketing and business development events.\r\n8.2Â  Where reasonable and practicable, SMG Health will collect personal information directly from the person and inform the person that this is being done.\r\n9.Â  WHAT ARE THE PURPOSES SMG HEALTH COLLECTS, HOLDS, USES OR DISCLOSES THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n9.1 Â SMG Health will use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it is collected.\r\n9.2Â  Personal information may also be used or disclosed by SMG Health for secondary purposes which are within the individualâ€™s reasonable expectations and which are related to the primary purpose of collection.\r\n9.3Â  SMG Health collects personal information to assist it in providing the client with their chosen product or service. The following are some reasons why SMG Health collects personal information for some of its products and services:\r\n(a)Â  Corporate wellness programs â€“ to assist customersâ€™ employees to implement healthy habits for sustainable behavioural change;\r\n(b)Â  Health assessments â€“ to provide health screening assessments for individuals;\r\n(c)Â  Online wellness â€“ to assist an individual in assessing their health risks and goals;\r\n(d)Â  Smoking cessation â€“ for individuals to take responsibility for and overcome their addition to tobacco;\r\n(e)Â  Flu Vaccination â€“ to reduce the risk in an individual contracting influenza;\r\n(f)Â  Weight management â€“ to provide weight management solutions;\r\n(g)Â  Trouble-shooting reported problems, education and other support for SMG Healthâ€™s diagnostic and laboratory tests;\r\n\r\n(h)Â  Other health products and services â€“ products and services designed to assist the individual with wellbeing solutions.\r\n9.4Â  SMG Health holds personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.\r\n9.5Â  SMG Health respects the individualâ€™s privacy concerns when personal information is disclosed and will take reasonable steps to keep it strictly confidential.\r\n9.6Â  SMG Health will disclose personal information to third parties if it is necessary to perform a service for which the primary purpose of the information was collected, or for a related secondary purpose, if the disclosure could be reasonably expected.Â  For example, SMG Health may share personal information with suppliers and other parties to allow delivery of the product or service. Where such a disclosure is necessary, SMG Health will take reasonable steps to ensure the third party treats the personal information in accordance with the Applicable Regulations.\r\n9.7Â  SMG Health may use personal information to send newsletters, to inform individuals about special offers or events, or for marketing purposes. Individuals can choose not to receive such communications.\r\n9.8Â  SMG Health may also buy, sell, merge or restructure its business or assets and personal information may be transferred as part of that change.\r\n9.9. Otherwise, SMG Health will only disclose personal information to third parties without the relevant individualâ€™s consent if the disclosure is permitted by Applicable Regulations.\r\n10.Â  WHY DOES SMG HEALTH USE COOKIES?\r\n\r\n10.1Â  The use of cookie technology allows SMG Health to collect information such as browser type and Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  geographical location as well as to identify and understand the navigation of visitors to the SMG HealthÂ Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  website.\r\n\r\n10.2Â  SMG Health uses cookies to:\r\n(a)Â  maximize the efficiency of a web site visit by delivering customised content and advertising;\r\n(b)Â  gauge the effectiveness of the siteâ€™s customised marketing materials; and\r\n(c)Â  investigate or take action regarding any unlawful activities.\r\n10.3Â  SMG Health does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about a person.

In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€.

However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work.

Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors.

We have\r\nimplemented challenges for many organisations with spectacular results.\r\nLetâ€™s take a brief look at some of our current Wellbeing Challengesâ€¦\r\nGet Active Challenge\r\nThere is no doubt that moving more and sitting less is good for your overall\r\nhealth. This 4-week challenge aims to motivate your people to include more\r\nexercise in each day.\r\nOur challenge is simple;\r\nTeams of up to 5 people record their daily activity levels. At the end of each\r\nweek a Team manager registers the teams total minutes of exercise on the\r\nWellbeing Challenges web portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most minutes is the\r\nwinner!\r\nThe challenge encourages participents to work together to create a daily\r\nexercise plan and share ideas for group exercise activities.\r\nParticipants will benefit from an overall increase in fitness levels, happiness\r\nand self esteem, as well as helping to reduce the risk of developing diabetes,\r\nheart disease, weight gain, osteoporosis and cancer.\r\nWeight Loss Challenge\r\nThe weight loss challenge aims to help reduce weight, specifically targeting\r\nâ€˜apple shapedâ€™ people who are already known to be at the greatest risk of\r\ndeveloping ill health or disease in future.\r\nOur challenge is simple\r\nTeams of up to 5 people aim to lose 1-2lbs per week, per participant.\r\nThe teams record their weekly weight loss. At the end of each week a Team\r\nmanager registers the teams total weight loss on the Wellbeing Challenges\r\nweb portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the greatest weight loss is\r\nthe winner!\r\nParticipants will benefit from feeling healthier, having more energy and an\r\nincreased sense of self-confidence.\r\nWe do not advocate any strange diets or eating plans. The Wellbeing\r\nChallenge advises participants to follow standard healthy eating guidelines\r\nand participate in moderate exercise.\r\nHydration Challenge\r\nWater is an essential nutrient of life. Adequate hydration is the key to short\r\nand long term healthy wellbeing. Drinking little and often throughout the day\r\ncan help us stay healthy and keep us alert.\r\nOur bodies lose approximately 2.5 litres of water each day. Even mild\r\ndehydration adversely affects both mental and physical performance.\r\nThe hydration challenge encourages employees to drink more fluids per day\r\nand teaches them how to recognise the signs of de-hydration.\r\nOur challenge is simple:\r\nThe Hydration Challenge is a points based challenge. Participants aim to\r\ncollect 2 hydration points per day over the 4 week programme.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most hydration points is\r\nthe winner! Prizes are awarded to the winning team and the highest scoring\r\nindividuals.\r\nSimply drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water or fluid each day can help to reduce\r\nfatigue, increase energy levels and provide greater focus and concentration.\r\nHealthy Eating Challenge\r\nThe healthy eating challenge encourages employees to eat a healthy\r\nbalanced diet every day.\r\nWhen it comes to a healthy diet, balance is the key to getting it right. This\r\nmeans eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming\r\nthe right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body\r\nweight.\r\nOur challenge is simple:\r\nThe Healthy Eating Challenge is a points based challenge. By following our\r\nrecommended healthy eating guidelines, participants aim to collect 6 healthy\r\neating points per day totaling a maximum of 42 per week.\r\nYour team manager registers your weekly points total on the Wellbeing\r\nChallenge web portal. At the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the\r\nmost points is the winner!\r\nThe Healthy Eating challenge encourages participants to achieve a balanced\r\ndiet by following both our food and drink guidelines and our 6 daily resilience\r\nhabits.\r\nCycling Challenge\r\nCycling is one of the most ergonomically efficient ways to exercise and is\r\nopen to all levels of ability.\r\nThe workplace cycle challenge aims to encourage employees to improve\r\nfitness through cycling.\r\nOur challenge is simple\r\nThe challenge is based on cycling miles. Teams of 1 to 5 people record how\r\nmany miles their team cycle over the 4 week programme. The team with the\r\nhighest number of cycle miles after 4 weeks is the winner!\r\nYour team manager registers the teams total cycle miles on the Wellbeing\r\nChallenges web portal each week. The winning team and individuals receive\r\nprizes for the most miles cycled.\r\nThis challenge is not about how fast you are.\r\nThe workplace cycle challenge is about encouraging employees to increase\r\ntheir physical activity, improve their fitness while having some fun on 2\r\nwheels!\r\nEnergy 4 Life Challenge\r\nOur energy levels dictate what we do and how well we do it. Expectation to\r\ndeliver has never been higher and yet 75% of the working population wakes\r\nup exhausted each day.\r\nThe Energy 4 Life challenge aims to boost energy levels to help employees\r\nget the most out of life, both at home and at work.\r\nThis challenge involves thinking about meals, sleep, movement, rest,\r\nrecuperation and work life balance. Our challenge is simple;\r\nParticipants are given 7 â€˜energy habitsâ€™ to follow each day, including moderate\r\nexercise, healthy eating and relaxation exercises.\r\nEach day, you collect one â€˜energy pointâ€™ for each habit you follow. Over each\r\nweek, you collect â€˜energy pointsâ€™ for your team.\r\nAt the end of each week, your team manager registers the teamâ€™s score on\r\nWellbeing Challenges web portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most points is the\r\nwinner!\r\nMaking simple daily choices such as eating regularly will not only boost your\r\nenergy, it will rejuvenate your life. Most people who have joined the challenge\r\nfeel fitter, more positive, have higher energy levels and feel more engaged at\r\nwork and at home.', 'Wellbeing Challenges', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'wellbeing-challenges', '', '', '2015-07-06 06:41:27', '2015-07-06 06:41:27', '', 0, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/?page_id=236', 0, 'page', '', 0),

At the end of each\r\nweek a Team manager registers the teams total minutes of exercise on the\r\nWellbeing Challenges web portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most minutes is the\r\nwinner!\r\nThe challenge encourages participents to work together to create a daily\r\nexercise plan and share ideas for group exercise activities.\r\nParticipants will benefit from an overall increase in fitness levels, happiness\r\nand self esteem, as well as helping to reduce the risk of developing diabetes,\r\nheart disease, weight gain, osteoporosis and cancer.\r\nWeight Loss Challenge\r\nThe weight loss challenge aims to help reduce weight, specifically targeting\r\nâ€˜apple shapedâ€™ people who are already known to be at the greatest risk of\r\ndeveloping ill health or disease in future.\r\nOur challenge is simple\r\nTeams of up to 5 people aim to lose 1-2lbs per week, per participant.\r\nThe teams record their weekly weight loss. At the end of each week a Team\r\nmanager registers the teams total weight loss on the Wellbeing Challenges\r\nweb portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the greatest weight loss is\r\nthe winner!\r\nParticipants will benefit from feeling healthier, having more energy and an\r\nincreased sense of self-confidence.\r\nWe do not advocate any strange diets or eating plans. The Wellbeing\r\nChallenge advises participants to follow standard healthy eating guidelines\r\nand participate in moderate exercise.\r\nHydration Challenge\r\nWater is an essential nutrient of life. Adequate hydration is the key to short\r\nand long term healthy wellbeing. Drinking little and often throughout the day\r\ncan help us stay healthy and keep us alert.\r\nOur bodies lose approximately 2.5 litres of water each day. Even mild\r\ndehydration adversely affects both mental and physical performance.\r\nThe hydration challenge encourages employees to drink more fluids per day\r\nand teaches them how to recognise the signs of de-hydration.\r\nOur challenge is simple:\r\nThe Hydration Challenge is a points based challenge. Participants aim to\r\ncollect 2 hydration points per day over the 4 week programme.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most hydration points is\r\nthe winner! Prizes are awarded to the winning team and the highest scoring\r\nindividuals.\r\nSimply drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water or fluid each day can help to reduce\r\nfatigue, increase energy levels and provide greater focus and concentration.\r\nHealthy Eating Challenge\r\nThe healthy eating challenge encourages employees to eat a healthy\r\nbalanced diet every day.\r\nWhen it comes to a healthy diet, balance is the key to getting it right. This\r\nmeans eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming\r\nthe right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body\r\nweight.\r\nOur challenge is simple:\r\nThe Healthy Eating Challenge is a points based challenge. By following our\r\nrecommended healthy eating guidelines, participants aim to collect 6 healthy\r\neating points per day totaling a maximum of 42 per week.\r\nYour team manager registers your weekly points total on the Wellbeing\r\nChallenge web portal. At the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the\r\nmost points is the winner!\r\nThe Healthy Eating challenge encourages participants to achieve a balanced\r\ndiet by following both our food and drink guidelines and our 6 daily resilience\r\nhabits.\r\nCycling Challenge\r\nCycling is one of the most ergonomically efficient ways to exercise and is\r\nopen to all levels of ability.\r\nThe workplace cycle challenge aims to encourage employees to improve\r\nfitness through cycling.\r\nOur challenge is simple\r\nThe challenge is based on cycling miles. Teams of 1 to 5 people record how\r\nmany miles their team cycle over the 4 week programme. The team with the\r\nhighest number of cycle miles after 4 weeks is the winner!\r\nYour team manager registers the teams total cycle miles on the Wellbeing\r\nChallenges web portal each week. The winning team and individuals receive\r\nprizes for the most miles cycled.\r\nThis challenge is not about how fast you are.\r\nThe workplace cycle challenge is about encouraging employees to increase\r\ntheir physical activity, improve their fitness while having some fun on 2\r\nwheels!\r\nEnergy 4 Life Challenge\r\nOur energy levels dictate what we do and how well we do it. Expectation to\r\ndeliver has never been higher and yet 75% of the working population wakes\r\nup exhausted each day.\r\nThe Energy 4 Life challenge aims to boost energy levels to help employees\r\nget the most out of life, both at home and at work.\r\nThis challenge involves thinking about meals, sleep, movement, rest,\r\nrecuperation and work life balance. Our challenge is simple;\r\nParticipants are given 7 â€˜energy habitsâ€™ to follow each day, including moderate\r\nexercise, healthy eating and relaxation exercises.\r\nEach day, you collect one â€˜energy pointâ€™ for each habit you follow. Over each\r\nweek, you collect â€˜energy pointsâ€™ for your team.\r\nAt the end of each week, your team manager registers the teamâ€™s score on\r\nWellbeing Challenges web portal.\r\nAt the end of the 4-week challenge the team with the most points is the\r\nwinner!\r\nMaking simple daily choices such as eating regularly will not only boost your\r\nenergy, it will rejuvenate your life. Most people who have joined the challenge\r\nfeel fitter, more positive, have higher energy levels and feel more engaged at\r\nwork and at home.', 'Wellbeing Challenges', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '236-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-06 06:36:53', '2015-07-06 06:36:53', '', 236, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/236-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We are a quality health management company (formerly Alere Health Management), now integrating physical and mental health services to provide workplaces with holistic health solutions aimed at enhancing wellbeing and productivity. A 2013 stress and wellbeing survey indicated that almost one in five Australians reported that current stress was having a strong impact on their physical health. In the same survey it was reported that this was impacting negatively in the workplace across a range of critical productivity criteria. This situation had deteriorated from surveys done in previous years. The reciprocal impact of mental health and physical health issues are now unequivocal. The need to provide integrated services to workplaces has never been more important. Over the forthcoming months we will be developing a range of new and exciting services to meet our charter: healthier and more productive workplaces. Watch this space.

In broad terms, â€˜personal informationâ€™ is information or opinions relating to an identifiable individual.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>3.2</strong> This Policy does not apply to acts and practices which relate directly to the employee records of SMG Healthâ€™s current and former employees.

However, SMG Health does not guarantee that personal information                   cannot be accessed by an unauthorised person (e.g. a hacker) or that unauthorised disclosures will not               occur.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>5.5</strong> SMG Health will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if that information is no longer needed.\r\n  <li>\r\n  <li><strong>5.6</strong> You may ask us to use a pseudonym or remain anonymous when providing personal information to us.

WHAT KINDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY SMG HEALTH COLLECT AND HOLD?</strong></p>\r\n<ul class="list_none_nav">\r\n<li><strong>6.1</strong> SMG Health collects personal information in order to effectively provide products and services.

WHAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION MAY SMG HEALTH COLLECT AND HOLD?</strong></p>\r\n<ul class="list_none_nav">\r\n  <li><strong>7.1</strong> â€˜Sensitive informationâ€™ is a subset of personal information and includes personal information that may have serious ramifications for the individual concerned if used inappropriately.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>7.2</strong> The sensitive information SMG Health may collect and hold about an individual may include:\r\n   <ul>\r\n   <li>    (a)  health and medical information;\r\n</li>\r\n   <li>    (b)  information regarding racial origins, ethnic origins, or other sensitive information relevant to health risk factors.</li>\r\n   \r\n   </ul>\r\n   </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>8.  HOW AND WHEN DOES SMG HEALTH COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>\r\n<ul class="list_none_nav">\r\n  <li> <strong>8.1</strong> SMG Health usually collects personal information in a variety of ways, and often from a third party, in the course of conducting its businesses, including:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>    (a)  from its clients when it provides products or services to those clients (for example, SMG Health may collect a clientâ€™s email address, name, date of birth and other contact information);\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (b)  when responding to questions regarding SMG Healthâ€™s products or services;\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (c)  when interacting with people via SMG Healthâ€™s website; and\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>    (d)  when conducting marketing and business development events.</li>\r\n  \r\n  </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <li><strong>8.2 </strong> Where reasonable and practicable, SMG Health will collect personal information directly from the person and inform the person that this is being done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>9.

The following are some reasons why SMG Health collects personal information for some of its products and services:\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>    (a)  Corporate wellness programs â€“ to assist customersâ€™ employees to implement healthy habits for sustainable behavioural change;\r\n</li>\r\n     <li>    (b)  Health assessments â€“ to provide health screening assessments for individuals;\r\n</li>\r\n      <li>    (c)  Online wellness â€“ to assist an individual in assessing their health risks and goals;\r\n</li>\r\n       <li>    (d)  Smoking cessation â€“ for individuals to take responsibility for and overcome their addition to tobacco;\r\n</li>\r\n        <li>    (e)  Flu Vaccination â€“ to reduce the risk in an individual contracting influenza;\r\n</li>\r\n         <li>    (f)  Weight management â€“ to provide weight management solutions;\r\n</li>\r\n            <li>    (g)  Trouble-shooting reported problems, education and other support for SMG Healthâ€™s diagnostic and laboratory tests;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>    (h)  Other health products and services â€“ products and services designed to assist the individual with wellbeing solutions.</li>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  <li><strong>9.4</strong> SMG Health holds personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.5 </strong> SMG Health respects the individualâ€™s privacy concerns when personal information is disclosed and will take reasonable steps to keep it strictly confidential.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.6</strong> SMG Health will disclose personal information to third parties if it is necessary to perform a service for which the primary purpose of the information was collected, or for a related secondary purpose, if the disclosure could be reasonably expected.  For example, SMG Health may share personal information with suppliers and other parties to allow delivery of the product or service. Where such a disclosure is necessary, SMG Health will take reasonable steps to ensure the third party treats the personal information in accordance with the Applicable Regulations.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.7</strong> SMG Health may use personal information to send newsletters, to inform individuals about special offers or events, or for marketing purposes. Individuals can choose not to receive such communications. </li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.8 </strong> SMG Health may also buy, sell, merge or restructure its business or assets and personal information may be transferred as part of that change.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.9.</strong> Otherwise, SMG Health will only disclose personal information to third parties without the relevant individualâ€™s consent if the disclosure is permitted by Applicable Regulations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>10.

The following are some reasons why SMG Health collects personal information for some of its products and services:\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>    (a)  Corporate wellness programs â€“ to assist customersâ€™ employees to implement healthy habits for sustainable behavioural change;\r\n</li>\r\n     <li>    (b)  Health assessments â€“ to provide health screening assessments for individuals;\r\n</li>\r\n      <li>    (c)  Online wellness â€“ to assist an individual in assessing their health risks and goals;\r\n</li>\r\n       <li>    (d)  Smoking cessation â€“ for individuals to take responsibility for and overcome their addition to tobacco;\r\n</li>\r\n        <li>    (e)  Flu Vaccination â€“ to reduce the risk in an individual contracting influenza;\r\n</li>\r\n         <li>    (f)  Weight management â€“ to provide weight management solutions;\r\n</li>\r\n            <li>    (g)  Trouble-shooting reported problems, education and other support for SMG Healthâ€™s diagnostic and laboratory tests;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>    (h)  Other health products and services â€“ products and services designed to assist the individual with wellbeing solutions.</li>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  <li><strong>9.4</strong> SMG Health holds personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.5 </strong> SMG Health respects the individualâ€™s privacy concerns when personal information is disclosed and will take reasonable steps to keep it strictly confidential.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.6</strong> SMG Health will disclose personal information to third parties if it is necessary to perform a service for which the primary purpose of the information was collected, or for a related secondary purpose, if the disclosure could be reasonably expected.  For example, SMG Health may share personal information with suppliers and other parties to allow delivery of the product or service. Where such a disclosure is necessary, SMG Health will take reasonable steps to ensure the third party treats the personal information in accordance with the Applicable Regulations.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>9.7</strong> SMG Health may use personal information to send newsletters, to inform individuals about special offers or events, or for marketing purposes.

Importantly these services assist in fulfilling our mission to provide holistic health services to organisations to enhance well-being and productivity. Initially our services will focus on 3 key areas: resilience; stress management; &amp; mindfulness. All these services will be key components of our Resilience, Wellbeing and Productivity programme. Later in 2015 we will be implementing a full online capability linking all these services across face to face, telephonic and on line delivery platforms leading to coaching, workshop, counselling, facilitation, assessment, and consulting services.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-4">\r\n\r\n<img class="img-thumbnail pull-left img-responsive " src="http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mental_health_services.png" alt="mental_health_services" width="300" height="200" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 ">\r\n<h2>Building Resilience Overview:</h2>\r\n<strong>1.1 WHAT IS RESILIENCE?</strong>\r\n<p><strong>1.1.1 Organisational Resilience</strong></p>\r\n<p>The capacity of resilience is found in an organisationâ€™s culture, attitudes and values. In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation.</p>\r\n	<p><strong>1.1.2Individual Employee Resilience</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Like organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work. Consequently an holistic approach to building resilience capacity needs to take into account both individual and organisational requirements.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 ">\r\n<p><strong>1.2 HOW RESILIENCE HELPS AN ORGANISATION?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being resilient can provide organisations with a competitive advantage. Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><strong>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</strong>\r\n<ul class="list-inline right_arrow text-justify">\r\n	<li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n	<li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n	<li>Workshops&amp; WebEx vignettes\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n	<li>Stress &amp; Resilience</li>\r\n	<li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.4 Stress Management </strong></p>\r\n<p>The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee. Consequently this can then impact negatively on workplace productivity. This is seen in increasing absenteeism, presenteeism, workers compensations costs, workplace conflict all of which work against the outcomes the organisation is seeking. Our stress management interventions will ensure greater safety, well-being and performance of your workforce while improving the productivity of the whole organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.5 Mindfulness and workplace engagement </strong></p><p>Engagement in our work matters. Low levels of engagement impact productivity and our sense of self-esteem. Most modern workplaces are undergoing constant change. Some far reaching and some subtle but all impacting to lesser or greater extent on employees. When substantive changes to our work (design, reporting duties etc.) occurs, we often need targeted mechanisms that provide employees with alternate pathways aimed at empowering them to take positive steps to reappraise their own circumstances. We have designed a number of workplace mindfulness programmes that focus on teaching employees the importance of taking responsibility for what is occurring in the present, and responding in ways that enhanced personal wellbeing and greater workplace engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n', 'Mental Health, Sleep & Fatigue Management', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '77-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-06 07:49:24', '2015-07-06 07:49:24', '', 77, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/77-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Importantly these services assist in fulfilling our mission to provide holistic health services to organisations to enhance well-being and productivity. Initially our services will focus on 3 key areas: resilience; stress management; &amp; mindfulness. All these services will be key components of our Resilience, Wellbeing and Productivity programme. Later in 2015 we will be implementing a full online capability linking all these services across face to face, telephonic and on line delivery platforms leading to coaching, workshop, counselling, facilitation, assessment, and consulting services.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-4">\r\n\r\n<img class="img-thumbnail pull-left img-responsive " src="http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mental_health_services.png" alt="mental_health_services" width="300" height="200" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 ">\r\n<h2>Building Resilience Overview:</h2>\r\n<strong>1.1 WHAT IS RESILIENCE?</strong>\r\n<p><strong>1.1.1 Organisational Resilience</strong></p>\r\n<p>The capacity of resilience is found in an organisationâ€™s culture, attitudes and values. In creating appropriate knowledge, culture, attitudes and values, an organisation builds its capacity to survive the turbulence created by low frequency and high consequence risks.\r\nResilience is the capability of an organisation to minimise the impact of severe disruption events on the business, the ability to â€œbounce backâ€. A highly resilient organisation would use disruption events as a focus to strengthen and grow the organisation.</p>\r\n	<p><strong>1.1.2Individual Employee Resilience</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Like organisations individual employees also have resilience capacity. However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work. Consequently an holistic approach to building resilience capacity needs to take into account both individual and organisational requirements.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 ">\r\n<p><strong>1.2 HOW RESILIENCE HELPS AN ORGANISATION?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being resilient can provide organisations with a competitive advantage. Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. Inherent in this approach is to ensure a supportive employee culture within the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><strong>1.3 Our Resilience Services:</strong>\r\n<ul class="list-inline right_nav text-justify">\r\n	<li>Organisational resilience audits\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Resilience questionnaire and baseline measurements</li>\r\n	<li>Aligning strategy, operations and systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience coaching</li>\r\n	<li>Workshops&amp; WebEx vignettes\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Resilient Teams</li>\r\n	<li>Stress &amp; Resilience</li>\r\n	<li>Energiser programs</li>\r\n	<li>Resilience Strategies for Managers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.4 Stress Management </strong></p>\r\n<p>The negative effects of stress can cause considerable damage to work performance, learning and well-being of the employee. Consequently this can then impact negatively on workplace productivity. This is seen in increasing absenteeism, presenteeism, workers compensations costs, workplace conflict all of which work against the outcomes the organisation is seeking. Our stress management interventions will ensure greater safety, well-being and performance of your workforce while improving the productivity of the whole organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-12 "><p><strong>1.5 Mindfulness and workplace engagement </strong></p><p>Engagement in our work matters. Low levels of engagement impact productivity and our sense of self-esteem. Most modern workplaces are undergoing constant change. Some far reaching and some subtle but all impacting to lesser or greater extent on employees. When substantive changes to our work (design, reporting duties etc.) occurs, we often need targeted mechanisms that provide employees with alternate pathways aimed at empowering them to take positive steps to reappraise their own circumstances. We have designed a number of workplace mindfulness programmes that focus on teaching employees the importance of taking responsibility for what is occurring in the present, and responding in ways that enhanced personal wellbeing and greater workplace engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n', 'Mental Health, Sleep & Fatigue Management', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '77-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-06 08:05:01', '2015-07-06 08:05:01', '', 77, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/77-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, in most cases organisations have no control over events that impact on employees outside the work environment, even though those very events (issues relating to finances, relationships, health etc) may indirectly impact at work.

Following a disruption an organisation with a higher degree of resiliency is more likely to return to a productive state than those who do not view organisational resilience as part of core business. A resilient organisation effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure and decision support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors.

Over the last 15 years he has designed and managed some of Australiaâ€™s largest and most successful workplace wellness programs. Over the last decade Tim has presented regularly at industry conferences in the areas of Best Practice and Return on Investment in workplace wellness. In his current role as Senior Commercial Account Manager, he is the responsible for the program design and relationship management for major clients throughout Australia and New Zealand as well as the management of SMGâ€™s Commercial Team.â€\r\n  \r\n  Title is tricky. Technically current title is â€œCommercial Account Managerâ€. However I want to differentiate my title from CAM, so it carries more weight with clients when issues get escalated â€“ so I have been unofficially using â€œSenior Commercial Account Managerâ€. As background, when Birgit (previous â€˜Health Management MDâ€™ then â€˜Strategic Relationships Managerâ€™) went on Mat leave â€“ I was given higher duties but no title change. Her role was made redundant but this has never been formally announced so had no impact on org structure or my official role / title. My current role includes duties within CAM, Strategic Relationships Manager and Health Management Business Manager.\r\n  \r\n  Suggestions below but Im happy with any title that fits within org structure so let me know your preference and Il use it from July 1st.\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Senior Commercial Account Manager</li>\r\n    <li>National Commercial Manager</li>\r\n    <li>National Relationships Manager</li>\r\n    <li>Business Manager</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-2 sen_me_tem"><a href="http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/team-4.png"><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive alignright wp-image-379 size-thumbnail" src="http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/team-4-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></div>\r\n', 'Senior Management Team', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '334-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-07 05:16:59', '2015-07-07 05:16:59', '', 334, 'http://111.93.163.213/SMGHealth/php/334-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
